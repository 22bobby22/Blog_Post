# Blog Post Project

In this project I'm going to use the data in the file `survey_results_public.csv`, that can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017 'https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017').

I will analyze this data to try and answer these three questions I have proposed to practice using _Jupyter Notebook_, _pandas_ and _numpy_:

1. Which countries have the most amount of people working from home?
2. Which countries are more keen to recommend online courses?
3. Do students program more as a hobby than professional developers?

## Dependencies

### Python

To install python: `pip install python`

### Pandas

To install pandas: `pip install pandas`

### Numpy

To install numpy: `pip install numpy`

### Matplotlib

To install matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`

### Jupyter Notebook

To install Jupyter Notebook: `pip install notebook`

## File Description

### CountryRemoteness.ipynb

In this file I analyze the data to answer the first question (Which countries have the most amount of people working from home?).

At the end I conclude that the United States is the country with the most amount of respondents that work from home at least a few days each month, while Germany is the country with the least amount, there being a difference between the two countries of 13.1%.

### OnlineRecommendation.ipynb

In this file I analyze the data to answer the second question (Which countries are more keen to recommend online courses?).

At the end I conclude that India is the country with the most percentage of respondents that recommend online courses, while Germany is the country with the least percentage, there is a difference of 10.4% between the two.

### ProgrammingHobby.ipynb

In this file I analyze the data to answer the third question (Do students program more as a hobby than professional developers?).

At the end I conclude that students program more as a hobby than professional developers by a margin of 10.6%. This may be caused by the loss of motivation or interest in programming when already working half a day in the subject.

## How to run

First you will have to clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/22bobby22/blog-post-project.git`

Then you can run the command `jupyter notebook` to open a _Jupyter Notebook_ in order to run the code cells in the files.
