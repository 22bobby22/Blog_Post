#Blog Post Project

In this project I'm going to use the data in the file survey_results_public.csv, that cand be downloaded here: [https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017]

I will analyze this data to try and answer these three questions I have proposed to practice using Jupyter Notebook, pandas and numpy:

1. Which countries have the most amount of people working from home?
2. Which countries are more keen to recommend online courses?
3. Do students program more as a hobby than professional developers?
